# Ohh Shiny

My youngest (just shy of 2 at this writing, born in January 2010 so if
you are interested in the math you can do it) likes really simple
interactions with all sorts of devices and I don't have anything that
really satisfies that. Everything has goals, time limits or other sorts
of specific interactions that must be satisfied and he isn't into that
sort of thing.

Anyway, to start things will just randomly happen when triggered by
all mouse and keyboard events, and to start starting, just the
background colour will change randomly.
